## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `base-images/chalupa-base-go`: Tier 1 shared base image built `FROM scratch` with CA certificates
  and nonroot user (UID 65532). Replaces the repeated `FROM scratch` + CA cert copy pattern across
  all Go services.
- `base-images/chalupa-base-job`: Tier 2 shared base image extending `chalupa-base-go` with static
  `bao` (OpenBao CLI v2.2.0), `nats` (natscli v0.2.3), and `jq` binaries for job/CronJob workloads.
- `.github/workflows/build-base-images.yml`: CI pipeline that builds and pushes both base images to
  the Gitea registry. Triggers on `base-images/**` path changes to main, weekly schedule (Monday
  4am UTC for security updates), manual dispatch, and semver git tags (`v*`). `chalupa-base-job`
  build depends on `chalupa-base-go` completing first.
- `renovate.json`: Added `dockerfile` manager and `hostRules` for `gitea.tailbecff0.ts.net`.
  Patch/minor base image bumps auto-merge; major bumps require dashboard approval.
- Extended `build-push-reusable.yml` with optional `context` input (default `.`) so callers can
  specify a subdirectory build context without duplicating buildx/login logic.
